# Burger

A link to the deployed app on Heroku: https://pacific-sierra-89428.herokuapp.com/

This app combines MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.  It allows you to see a list of burgers on a menu, see burgers that 
have already been devoured.  It also allows you to add in new burgers with a name.  Each Burger on the menu has a Devour It! button that 
allows the user to eat the burger;  It also moves the burger from the menu to the devoured burgers section of the site.
